Databel Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)
Project Overview

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this case study, I analyzed a dataset from a fictitious telecom company called Databel to investigate their churn rates.

The goal of this project was not just to calculate the overall churn rate, but to figure out why customers are leaving and how to reduce that churn. I built this interactive dashboard using measures and calculated columns to provide actionable insights for customer retention.
Key Insights Discovered

Based on the dashboard analysis, here are the primary drivers of churn at Databel:

    Overall Churn: Databel currently has a churn rate of 26.86%, representing 1,796 lost customers out of a total 6,687.

    The Competitor Threat: Competitors are the largest category driving churn, accounting for 44.82% of all lost customers. The top two specific reasons customers leave are that a competitor made a better offer or had better devices.

    The Month-to-Month Problem: Contract type plays a massive role in retention. Customers on Month-to-Month contracts have a churn rate of 46.29%, compared to just 6.62% for Yearly contracts. This is a significant risk, as Month-to-Month contracts make up 51.01% of Databel's customer base.

    Demographics & Groups: Seniors (who are not under 30) have a notably high churn rate of 38.46%. Additionally, customers who are part of a group (2 or more customers) have a much lower average churn rate than individual customers.

    Geographic Hotspots: The map visual indicates a high concentration of churned customers in California.

Recommendations for Databel

    Incentivize Yearly Contracts: Since Month-to-Month users churn at 46.29%, Databel should offer strong discounts or perks to convert these users into 1-year or 2-year contracts.

    Target Competitor Offers: With competitors driving 44.82% of churn, Databel needs to evaluate their device pricing and promotional offers to remain competitive, especially in high-churn states like California.

    Promote Group Plans: Since customers in groups of 2 or more show lower churn, Databel should run marketing campaigns encouraging users to add family members to their plans.
